# Sportradar Event Schedule
&ndash; this project has been created as part of the application process for Sportradar Coding Academy, Coding Exercise (BE) &ndash;

## About
The Sportradar Event Schedule brings to you a lively display of all the hottest sports events around the world - from soccer to baseball to basketball, using primarily PHP, MYQSL, HTML & CSS, using some OOP and elementary concepts of the MVC framework (please note I have very minimal experience with this, so tried my best to make the most out the situation - but it is not a full MVC program or fully object-oriented!).
You can filter through events to get results based on your favorite sport or a date range, and can add new events to do the database.

## How To
This project uses XAMPP and phpMyAdmin to run the database local hosting and interaction. It is recommended to have these set up as a first stage, along with PHP installed in order to run the Event Schedule successfully.
The database included in the project files already has sample data inserted into it, including a database creation query, so it's good to go with the upload via phpMyAdmin.
You can then run a local host server and off we go - the Event Schedule is ready!

## Details
In this project you can find database architecture and a database built from scratch to support the functions needed to maintain the display. The database includes an Event entity, Team, Venue and Sport entities (all including foreign key connections between them to communicate properly), and a many-to-many table for Venue_Sport, as sport events can be held at a variety of venues and venues can often hold events of various different sports (Staples Center anyone?).
The project creates an Event class Model with functions that create objects from the class, insert new ones into the database, and an EventController which holds functions that pertain to the Event class but aren't directly performed on an object of Event, and mainly - they process data collected from the user's input on View pages (index.php, event_results.php & create_event.php), and tell the View or the Model what action should be taken.
All events, both past and future, are displayed on the index.php page, with the option to filter through events based on sport or date range (it is not necessary to fill in all 3 fields to filter the events), or click a button to be transferred to a form page to add a new event.
After filtering, you will be transferred to the event_results.php page, with your requested filter displayed. You can always continue filtering through from the page and the display will be updated accordingly.
If you'd like to add a new event, go ahead to the create_event.php page, where you'll find a form to fill out with all the details. Beware of error messages in the form in case you enter illogical data (e.g. a soccer team cannot play a basketball team)!
